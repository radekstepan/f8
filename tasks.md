# Tasks

System instruction: Work through every item in ## List below, top to bottom, executing each task in its own fresh subagent. Rules:

1. One task per subagent: spawn a single subagent for the current list item only, giving it the task text plus everything below as its brief.
2. Strictly sequential: wait for the subagent to finish (and its commit to land) before spawning the next one. Never run two task subagents in parallel.
3. Each subagent must: implement the task, add tests covering the change, and commit the result on completion.
4. Do not run Playwright (unit/integration tests only).
5. Each commit must include a writeup of what changed in `docs/tasks/NN-<slug>.md` (`<slug>` = short kebab-case summary). Numbering is one continuous running log shared by all runs: before writing, list `docs/tasks`, take the highest numeric prefix in use, and use that number + 1, zero-padded to at least 2 digits (e.g. after `66-...` comes `67-...`). Never restart at `01`, never reuse a number, never leave gaps. Record any important decisions in that writeup.
6. If a task changes architecture or introduces a complex feature, update the app documentation (README.md) in the same commit.
7. If a task is blocked or fails, stop the loop and report — do not skip ahead to the next item.
8. Keep track of learnings from each task. Then once done with all of the tasks summarize the learnings into a markdown document so that we do not repeat the same mistakes over and over (in `docs/learnings.md`).
9. Each subagent must add a changeset (`yarn changeset`) describing its change and include it in the same commit, so versions keep moving. See `.changeset/README.md` and the "Versioning" section in `docs/development.md` for the workflow.
